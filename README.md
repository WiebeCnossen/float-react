# The float puzzle

Divs are displayed with `float: left;`. The goal is to make a rectangle with them.
In order to do that, you can swap two blocks until the goal is reached.

The creation of the puzzle and the presentation of the divs has been implemented. The rest is up to you.

Decide together which and how many of the stories to implement.

## Story: as a user I want to subsequently click on two blocks to swap them

## Story: As a user I want to be able to start a new puzzle

* the user wants to choose between Easy (n=5), Normal (n=7) and Hard (n=10); this is a requirement
* the user prefers not to get a _solved_ puzzle; this is _not_ a requirement.

## Story: as a user I want to get a message when the puzzle has been solved

## Story: as a user I want to request a hint which 2 blocks could be swapped to make progress

## Story: as a user I want the puzzle to be (visually) attractive
